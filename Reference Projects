Testing the wind speed
Possible feature list from Mr Gibbs
    Speed
    VMG - Velocity made good - Speed calculated as if the boat were traveing straight from one mark to the next
    VMC - Velocity made good on course - Speed calculated as rate of closure from the boat to the next mark
    COG - Course over ground - Actual direction the boat is moving (not pointing)
    Heading (Magnetic) - Direction the boat is pointed
    Heading (True) - Direction the boat is pointed, corrected for declination
    Heel
    Top Speed
    Countdown
    Distance to Mark
    Pitch
    VMG % - The % of boatspeed that is along the course, eg 10 knots 45 degrees of course = 5 knots
    VMC % - The % of boatspeed that is toward the mark
    Current Tack Delta - The system remembers the heading at the start of the current tack. Current tack delta is the current heading subtracted from the heading at the start of the tack, so it will indicate if you have been lifted or headed since tacking.
    Course Relative - The current heading, subtracted from the angle of the course (aka how many degrees off the course are you)

If the wind sensor is used, the following values are also available

    Apparent Wind Angle
    Apparent Wind Speed
    True Wind Angle
    True Wind Direction
    True Wind Speed
    Mast Heel/Pitch
    Mast Bend
    Target Speed for Current Wind
    Current Speed as % of Targe Speed
